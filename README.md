# mbed

Started developing software in mbed platform during internship at METU Technopolis.

Most of the code is written in C++ for LPC1768 or NUCLEO-F411RE development boards.

I will be updating my existing code and writing new ones for my robotic projects. Check out [my profile](https://developer.mbed.org/users/BaserK/) on ARM mbed website.
